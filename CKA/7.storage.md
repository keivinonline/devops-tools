# storage
## Storage for docker
- 2 types of storage
    - 1. storage drivers
    - 2. volume drivers
### Docker file system
- `/var/lib/docker` is created by default
  - `aufs` is the default storage driver
  - `containers` 
  - `image`
  - `volumes`
- docker uses layered architecture 
- each line in docker file creates a new layer
```yaml
FROM ubuntu # Base ubuntu layer

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install python -y # changes in apt

...

ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```
- this allows for faster builds by reusing layers from cache
- layers are read-only
- when `docker run` is executed, a new writable layer is created on top of the read-only layers AKA `container layer`
- to run a docker with data volume, we need to mount a volume to the container
```bash
docker volume create data_volume
/var/lib/docker
|_ volumes
|__ data_volume
# to mount to docker
docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```
- on host: /var/lib/docker/volumes/data_volume
- on container: /var/lib/mysql
### types of mounting
1. volume mounting
- reference volume name that is created by docker command `docker volume create`
- `docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql`
2. bind mounting
- reference a directory on the host
- `docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql`
- using `-v` is the old style
- using `-mount` is the new style
```bash
docker run \
--mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql
```
### Storage drivers
- storage drivers are responsible for managing the contents of the image layers and the writable container layer
- examples
    - aufs # default for ubuntu
    - overlay, overlay2
    - BTRFS
    - device mapper
### Volume drivers
- volume drivers are responsible for managing the contents of the volumes
- default is `local`
- 3rd party volume drivers
    - flocker
    - glusterfs
    - convoy
    - rexray
    - portworx
    - etc
```bash
docker volume create --driver rexray --opt=size=100 myvol
```
## Container Storage interface
- CRI is a standard for container runtime
- allows 3rd party storage providers to integrate with container runtimes
- same goes for Container Storage Interface (CSI) and container networking interface (CNI)
- CSI is a universal plugin mechanism for container runtimes
### CSI 
- defines standard RPC calls between container orchestrators and storage providers
## Volumes
- meant to be transient
### sample volume using host path
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: my-pod
    name: alpine
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt
      name: my-vol
      
  volumes:
  - name: my-vol
    hostPath:
      path: /data
      type: Directory

```
## Persistent volumes
- is a cluster wide pool of storage volumes
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-vol1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID: 

```
### `persistent volume claims`
- every PVC is bound to a PV matching the claim
- if there are multiple matches, can use labels and selectors
- 1 to 1 mapping between PVC and PV
- PVC will remain in pending state if no PV matches
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```
- when a PVC is deleted, the PV is not deleted and retained
- this depends on `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`
- can be `Retain`, `Delete`, `Recycle`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: mypod
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPaths: "/var/www/html"
      name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim
```

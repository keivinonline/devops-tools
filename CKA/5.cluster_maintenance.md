# cluster maintenance
## Operating system upgrade
### what happens when a node is offline
- if pods are part of replicaset, they will be recreated on other nodes
- `eviction timeout` 
    - when pods are evicted from a node if node is offline for more than 5 minutes (default)
- for maintenance task for nodes
    - drain the node of pods
    - cordon the node (marked as unschedulable)
    - upgrade the node
    - uncordon the node
## K8s releases
- e.g. `v1.11.3` 
- `1` is the major version
- `11` is the minor version release every few months
- `3` is the patch version
- v1.0 is rleeased on july 2015
- etcd and coredns have their own release cycle
## Cluster upgrade process
- kube-apiserver is should have the highest version
- controller-manager and kube-schedulers can be x-1 version
- kubelet and kube-proxy can be at x-2 version
- kubectl can be x+1 higher or x-1 lower
### upgrade process
- k8s only support 3 minor releases behind
- e.g. when v1.12 is release, support is only up to v1.10
- should upgrade 1 minor version at a time, e.g. v1.10 -> v1.11
### upgrading process
1. upgrade master nodes
- control plane components briefly go down
    - apiserver
    - scheduler
    - controller-manager
- all workloads are not affected, only mgmt functions are down
2. upgrade worker nodes
- can upgrade all at once
- or 1 by 1 (drain and cordon)
3. provision new nodes with new versions 
- easier to do in cloud environments
- drain and cordon old nodes
#### using kubeadm
- `kubeadm upgrade plan` 
    - check if upgrade is possible
- kubelet needs to be manually upgraded.

## Maintenance
```bash
k drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets
k uncordon <node>
```

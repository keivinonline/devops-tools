# Scheduling

## Manual Scheduling

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeName: node01 # by default it is empty
```
- pods will be in `pending` state if the node is not scheduled 
- ways to manually schedule pods
1. can manually assign pods by setting nodename field in pod spec
    - this can only be done during pod creation
2. create a `Binding` object to bind pod to node
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Binding
metadata:
  name: nginx
target:
  apiVersion: v1 
  kind: Node
  name: node01
```
## Labels and Selectors
- labels are used to categorize objects
- selectors are used to select objects based on labels
```bash
# filtering using selectors
k get pods --selector app=nginx
```
## Annotations
- used to record other details about objects
- e.g. buildversion of the image

## Taints and Tolerations
- tells tainted nodes to only accept certain pods with tolerations
- does not guarantee or tell pods which node to be scheduled
- nothing to do with security
- taints are applied on nodes
- tolerations are applied on pods
- taints and tolerations are used to control pod scheduling
- example
    - applied taint on nodes (e.g. taint=blue)
    - apply toleration on pods which will be scheduled on the tainted nodes (e.g. toleration=blue)
- `taint-effect` defines the effect of pods that DO NOT tolerate the taint 
    - `NoSchedule` - pods will not be scheduled on the tainted nodes
    - `PreferNoSchedule` - pods will be scheduled on the tainted nodes but not preferred
    - `NoExecute` - pods will not be scheduled on the tainted nodes and will be evicted if already scheduled
```bash
# applying taints on nodes
k taint nodes node01 key=value:taint-effect
# example from above
k taint nodes node01 app=blue:NoSchedule
```
- tolerations are added to pod
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  # all values need to be in double quotes
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
## Node Selectors
- done via labels on nodes and selectors on pods
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx1
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    size: large # this is the label on the node
```
- to label the node
```bash
k label nodes node01 size=large
```
- limitations of nodeSelectors
- cannot specify multiple values or complex expressions
## Node Affinity
- ensure pods are hosted on nodes with specific labels
- node affinity types
1. `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` - pods will only be scheduled on nodes with matching labels
2. `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` - pods will be scheduled on nodes with matching labels but not guaranteed
- `duringSchedule` - when pods do no exist and are being scheduled
- `duringExecution` - when pods are already running and node labels are changed
## Resource Limits
- if insufficient resources are available, pods will be in `pending` state
- by default, pods are
  - 0.5 vCPU
  - 256 Mi memory
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
- name: nginx-pod
  image: nginx
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "1" # 1 vCPU
    limits:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "2" 
```
- a container can use more memory that its limits but will be terminated if it does so constantly
- if a container uses more CPU than its limits, it will be throttled
### LimitRange object
- used to set default limits and requests for pods
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: resources-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: 256Mi
    defaultRequest:
      memory: 256Mi
    type: Container
```
## Daemonsets
- ensures all nodes have 1 copy of the pod
- uses cases
  - monitoring agent
  - logging agent
  - network proxy
- definition file same as ReplicaSet except for `kind`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-daemon
spec:
  ...
```
- Before v1.12, DaemonSets uses `nodeName` field to schedule pods on specific nodes
- After v1.12, DaemonSets uses `NodeAffinity` and the default scheduler
## Static Pods
- Kubelet
    - relies on Kube-API server
    - can manage independently by itself 
    - can be used to manage static pods
- can configured kubelet to read definition files from a directory
    - `--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests` in kubelet.service
- or alternatively use a config file path `--kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`
```yaml
# contents of kubeconfig.yaml
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```
- pods created by kubelet can only be viewed via `docker ps` command
- kubelet can act as a master in the absence of a master
- but limited to pods only. no services, no deployments, etc
- kubelet can only understand pods
- can create pods via 
1. from static pod definition files
2. via HTTP endpoint 
- when kubelet creates a static pod
    - it creates a mirror pod on the API server
- why use static pods ?
    - deploy control plane components
- this is how kubeadm deploys control plane components
### Static Pods vs Daemonsets
- Both are ignored by kube-scheduler
1. Static Pods
- create by kubelet
- deploy control plane components
2. Daemonsets
- create by kube-api server (daemon controller)
- deploy monitoring agents, logging agents etc
### how to check if a pod is a static pod ? 
- check `ownerReferences` field in pod spec
## Multiple Schedulers
- can write your own scheduler and deploy it
- the default is `default-scheduler`
```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
- schedulerName: my-scheduler
leaderElection: # for HA setup
  leaderElect: true
  resourceNamespace: kube-system
  resourceName: lock-object-my-scheduler
```
- to set a pod with a custom scheduler
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  schedulerName: my-scheduler # set the custom scheduler here
```
## Scheduler Profiles
- pods end up in a 
1. scheduling queue to be sorted based on priority and other factors
- done via `PrioritySore` plugin
- this is from a `PriorityClass` object
2. Filter phase
- done bia `NodeResourcesFit`, `NodeName`, `NodeUnschedulable` plugins
3. Scoring phase
- `NodeResourcesFit` plugin
- `ImageLocality` plugin
- pods are scored based on weights
4. Binding phase
- `DefaultBinder`
- pod is bound to a node
### Multiple schedulers
- might run into race conditions
- in v1.18, you can configure multiple profiles for a single scheduler within a single binary
- example of custom scheduler
```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
- schedulerName: my-scheduler
  plugins:
    score:
      disabled:
      - name: TaintToleration
      enabled:
      - name: MyCustomPluginA
```

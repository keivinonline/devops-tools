# security

## Security Primitives
- controlling access to kube-apiserver
- Authentication
  - who can access?
- RBAC authorization
    - What can they do ?
- all communication is secured using TLS encryption
- all pods can access all other pods by default

## Authentication
- k8s does not manage user accounts natively
- relies on 3rd party services
- can manage service accounts natively
### Auth mechanisms
- for static password and token files, use a volume mount
1. static password file
- pass csv file to kube-apiserver with`basic-auth-file` flag
```csv
password,user,uid,groups
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: kube-apiserver
spec:
    containers:
    - command:
        - kube-apiserver
        ...
        - --basic-auth-file=user-details.csv
```
- to authenticate, use the command
```bash
curl -v -k https://master-node:6443/api/v1/pods -u "user:password" 
```
2. static token file
`--token-auth-file` flag
```csv
token123,user,uid,groups
```
- to authenticate, use the command
```bash
curl -kv https://master-node:6443/api/v1/pods \
--header "Authorization: Bearer token123"
```
3. certificates
4. identity providers

## TLS introduction
- Transport Layer Security
- certs are used to guaranteed trust between 2 parties
-
